    "## 1. Polarization & Spatial Parity\n",
    "\n",
    "In the paper \\[topic 2\\] the experiments which were done were made using of an optical beam model with two binary degrees of freedom, them being polarization and spatial parity along the $x$ direction respectively of a quasi monochromatic source.<br>\n",
    "For the spatial parity, in one dimension the beams are of form $E(x) = E_e\\psi_e(x)+E_o\\psi_o(x)$ where $\\psi_e(x)$ is an even function and $\\psi_o(x) = \\text{sgn}(x)\\psi_e(x)$ hence is an odd function. We give this beam a vector representation called $\\mathbf{J}_\\text{par} = [E_e\\text{ } E_o]^T$. Spatial paritt is manipulated using a spatial light modulator (SLM) which we describe in the experimental apparatus section. Along with the horizontal (H) and vertical components of polarization taken into account we describe the polarization-parity jones vector as $\\mathbf{J} = [E_\\text{He}\\text{ }E_\\text{Ho}\\text{ }E_\\text{Ve}\\text{ }E_\\text{Vo}]^T$.<br>\n",
    "We then describe the properties of this coherence using a $4\\times4$ matrix which is $\\mathbf{G} = \\langle\\mathbf{J}^{*}\\mathbf{J}^\\text{T}\\rangle$. Taking partial trace along $\\mathbf{G}$ would give us either $\\mathbf{G}_\\text{pol}$ or $\\mathbf{G}_\\text{par}$ on taking trace along parity or polarization respectively. We define a degree of polarization/parity using $D_{\\text{pol}}$($D_\\text{par}$) which quantifies the apparent coherence of each DoF when the other DoF is unresolved. Further an overall coherence $S$ is defined using the beam's linear entropy \\[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_entropy\\] as follows.\n",
    "The definition of linear entropy comes from the motivation of von Neumann Entropy. For a quantum mechanical system with a density matrix $\\rho$ this is defined as $S_v = \\text{Tr}(-\\rho\\ln(\\rho)) = -\\langle\\ln(\\rho)\\rangle$. The linear entropy $S_L$ is a lower approximation to $S_v$ which comes from expanding the leading term in the expansion of $\\rho\\ln\\rho$ which becomes $\\rho-\\rho^2$ approximately when $\\rho$ is close to $I$ (using taylor expansion) and taking trace this gives us the definition $S_L = \\text{Tr}(\\rho) - \\text{Tr}(\\rho^2)$ and by definition of the density matrix we have trace of $\\rho$ equal to 1 which gives us $S_L = 1 - \\text{Tr}(\\rho^2)$. This is a non normalized quantity so this is normalized by multiplying it by $\\frac{d}{d-1}$ which here is $4/3$ since our system has four dimensions. The definition of our $\\mathbf{G}$ matrix is isomorphic to the definition of a density matrix of a two qubit system keeping the Jones vector $\\mathbf{J}$ as the state of this two qubit system. Hence we have \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:1.1}\\tag{1.1}S = 1-S_L = 1 - \\frac{4}{3} + \\frac{4}{3}\\text{Tr}(\\mathbf{G}^2) = \\frac{4}{3}\\left(\\text{Tr}\\{\\mathbf{G}^2\\}-\\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\end{equation}\n",
    "We know that for normalized states we have that $\\frac{1}{d}\\leq$ Tr$(\\rho^2) \\leq 1$ and equals one only for a pure state and $1/d$ for completely mixed state. We can similarly draw a parallel here to seeing that $S=1$ happens only for coherent (pure) states and is 0 when completely incoherent. An important note to make here is that applying a unitary matrix $U$ (so $U^{*}U^{T} = I$) which is not time dependent on the Jones vector would not change our value of $S$ since on acting of a unitary we would have $\\mathbf{G}' = U^{*}\\mathbf{G}U^{T}$ and so $\\mathbf{G}'^2 = U^{*}\\mathbf{G}^2U^{T}$ and this has same trace as $\\mathbf{G}^2$ since trace is invariant under unitary transforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper here explores the properties of a beam where these two DoFs are infact coupled or entagled. One can start with a coherent linearly polarized beam at $45^\\circ$ with even polarity which would be $\\mathbf{J} = (1/\\sqrt{2})[\\text{1 0 1 0}]^T$ which can clearly be factored into a direct product of $\\mathbf{J}_{\\text{pol}}\\otimes\\mathbf{J}_\\text{par}$ and so $D_\\text{pol} = D_\\text{par} = 1$. However on passing this beam through a polarization sensitive SLM which introduces a phase of $\\varphi/2\\sin(\\varphi)$ only to the horizontal polarity component and none to the vertical. We can think of this analoguos to a controlled $R_x(\\varphi)$ operation from the polarization qubit to parity qubit which acts when polarization is $|0\\rangle$ (called H here for polarization). This puts the state to an entagled state $\\mathbf{J} = (1/\\sqrt{2})[\\cos(\\varphi/2)\\text{ }\\iota\\sin(\\varphi/2)\\text{ 1 0}]^T$ which is no longer factorizable and shows that the apparant degree of coherence of the individual DoFs are no longer equal to 1 unless $\\varphi=0$ and infact equal zero when $\\varphi=\\pi$. However we know that this state is still coherent on an overall, the only issue is that seeing the partial trace of $\\mathbf{G}$ along the respective DoF provide an incomplete picture of the state hence leading to a conclusion that the coherence is absent. The paper proceeds to make use of the Bell's measure (see Appendix A) to quantify this entaglement which is the cause of this apparent coherence deficit."

    "For the experimental setup, we are using various separate components, which we will comment on one by one before seeing how they are arranged together for the experiment in this paper. We can develop a matrix operator formalism based on how these elements affect the vector $\\mathbf{J} = [E_{He} \\ E_{Ho} \\ E_{Ve} \\ E_{Vo}]$. Suppoe we have a device that modifies the Jones vector of a beam in the following way - $\\mathbf{J_{new}} = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{J_{old}}$. Then, the corresponding $\\mathbf{G} = \\langle \\mathbf{J^*J^T}\\rangle$ tranforms as $\\mathbf{G_{new} = A^*G_{old}A^T}$. This is because, assuming that the effect of the device, encoded in matrix $\\mathbf{A}$  is time independent, the matrix can just move inside the time average.

We can either correct this with a second reflection of that beam from a $45^\\circ$ mirror to correct it or not do anything at all about it (in the experimental setup in the paper seen as a whole, we can see that it won't matter the odd and even beams will be switched, but that is about it.)\n",

    "One thing about mirrors which is particularly inconvenient is that the incoming and outgoing beam does not travel in the same direction, so we cannot conveniently include a mirror in the arm of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer easily, for example. To make our life simple, we use a dove prism, which is a trapezoid shaped prism, that the light beam enters, undergoes TIR on one surface of it and exits travelling in the same direction as incoming beam. It performs the same matrix operation as a mirror, but is more convenient to use. One aspect to be careful of (that can be easily overcome) is that there is a phase change because the beam travels through the glass/ material of the prism, but that can be easily dealt with by using a compensator cell in the other arm. Aother important aspect of a Dove prism - since the wave incidence medium is denser and the transmission medium is rarer (unlike a regular mirror), there is no addition $\\pi$ phase of reflection, and the operator matrix is simply $$\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}e \\\\ o \\end{pmatrix}_{old} = \\begin{pmatrix}e \\\\ o \\end{pmatrix}_{new}$$\n",

Suppose the only input beam is given from In1. Then, the left beam suffers two rarer-denser reflections and the same is the case with the right beam, as they come out from Out2. Hence, we have constructive interference at Out2. Whereas, as Out1, the left beam still has same phase (the reflection at exit beam splitter is denser-rarer, so no phase change) while the right beam has one reflection only, so the interference is destructive.</p>\n",
    "<p>With a dove prism in place, the odd mode undergoes one extra inversion in the left path, so its constructive/destructive outputs are now exactly swapped.

    "A SLM is a spatial light modulator. In general, this term refers to any device that modifies the beam in a space dependent fashion. In the context of this experiment, the SLM they use (Hamamatsu X10468-02) is an array of liquid crystal pixels, each of whose refractive index can be controlled independently by applying a voltage, in such a way, that we add a desired phase to the light passing through each pixel, and the phase in each pixel is independent of the others.\n",
    "<p>Suppose we send a beam through a SLM which adds a $x$-dependant phase $\\frac{\\phi}{2}sgn(x)$ to the electric field (global phase does not matter here, by the way. Only relative phase/ difference in phase between top and bottom half being $\\phi$ is what matters.) Then, we are effectively multiplying the old profile $E_{old}(x)$ by $e^{\\iota\\frac{\\phi}{2}sgn(x)}$, to get new profile $E_{new}(x)$. Observe that $e^{\\iota\\frac{\\phi}{2}sgn(x)} = cos(\\frac{\\phi}{2})+ \\iota sgn(x)sin(\\frac{\\phi}{2})$. So, with $E_{old}(x) = e(x)+o(x)$, we can get $E_{new}(x) = (e(x)+o(x))(cos(\\phi/2)+\\iota sgn(x)sin(\\phi/2)) = [cos(\\phi/2)e(x) + \\iota sin(\\phi/2) sgn(x)o(x)] + [cos(\\phi/2)o(x) + \\iota sin(\\phi/2) sgn(x)e(x)]$. </p>\n",
    "<p>Observe that the first term in the new expression is even while the second term is odd, which means that they are the new even and odd decomposition (which is unique). We can re-express this as $\\begin{pmatrix}cos(\\phi/2) & \\iota sin(\\phi/2) \\\\ \\iota sin(\\phi/2) & cos(\\phi/2) \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}e_{old} \\\\ o_{old}\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}e_{new} \\\\ o_{new}\\end{pmatrix}$ to make it look more like the transformation caused by a half wave plate, but for the parity DOF. In particular, observe that if we set $\\phi = \\pi$ then the matrix shown looks like a Pauli $\\sigma_x$ matrix (times the constant $\\iota$)- it swaps the $o$ and $e$ bases.\n",

Then, the idea is to split up the input beam into the odd and even components with an MZI and then recombine them with a second MZI. In this way, a parity-controlled operation can be performed. The below image shows a schematic for a parity-sensitive HWP.</p>\n",

Then, by coupling the parity to the polarisation, we can generate a coupled-DOF beam. To convert this beam to a completely polarised, parity-incoherent beam, we would need to implement a parity-controlled polarisation operation, which this section proposes a theoretical solution to accomplishing. One major issue still here, is that stacking two MZI's could be a challenge, in view of the difficulty of alignment."

    "## 6. Quantum Circuits\n",
    "As one may have already noticed, the behavior of the system here can be accurately modelled using quantum systems where instead of coherence one measures the purity of a state. We make use of the IBM Qiskit libraries to build these experimental setups into their equivalent quantum circuits making use of ancillary qubits to create inherently mixed states. The main idea here is that for experiment A we would only need the two qubits each representing one DoF to model this system and reproduce the results using the appropriate operators.\n",
    "### Interpretation of the model\n",
    "<p>The first qubit (indexed by 0) refers to the polarisation DOF and the second qubit (index 1) refers to the parity DOF. We will take the $|1\\rangle$ state of polarity to mean pure V-polarisation and $|0\\rangle$ state to mean pure H-polarisation. Similarly, we take the $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ states of the parity qubit to mean purely even and purely odd mode, respectively.</p>\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "    <tr><td>Parity-polarisation state</td><td>Qubit configuration</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>He</td><td>00</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>Ho</td><td>01</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>Ve</td><td>10</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>Vo</td><td>11</td></tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "<p>Further, we will always use any ancilla qubits we need, to replicate the probabilistic devices (like random rotator or probabilistic PS-SLM) to be the initial qubits, the second last qubit will represent polarisation, and the last qubit represents parity.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "For experiment B one of our state is starting in an impure form, something which cannot be reached if one were to only apply unitary transformations. Here we make use of an ancillary qubit which is coupled with the rest of the two qubits and hence is in a way storing the coherence we wished to get rid off as part of it's coupling. The main idea of this paper was that partial trace matrices do not give us the complete picture of the system which we can demonstrate very simply just by using a bell state (a pure state) and noting that it's partial traces are actually representative of impure states.\n",

    "A small point to add is that in qiskit the representation is not with zeroth qubit being MSB and last qubit being LSB but the other way round. In experiment A for example $q_0$ is the polarization qubit and $q_1$ is the parity qubit and so Ho is actually 10 and Ve is 01 and so on."

    "### 6.1 Experiment A\n",
    "For this experiment we take $q_0$ as the polarization DoF and $q_1$ as the parity DoF. Based on the matrix forms of the experimental apparatus we can see that applying an HWP is analogous to a $R_y(\\theta)Z$ on $q_0$ and the SLM is $R_x(-\\phi)$ and the PSSLM is just the SLM as a controlled operation except that it activates for $q_0$ being in 0 instead of 1 so we just apply a NOT on that bit before and after the controlled gate. The measurement done in the end uses the statevector simulator of qiskit to directly calculate probabilities based on the state of the system. While running multiple shots using one of the real quantum computers one can access using IBM-Q would have been more impressive, those will come with heavy noise outputs would require additional noise and error mitigation procedures."

    "Here in the experiment a random rotator is used to generate what would be measured as unpolarized light. As stated before the coherence of a the DoFs are analogous to a qubit being in a mixed or pure state. Since we are working with idealized qubits the state of the system will always remain pure however if one were to look into just the hilbert space of few of the qubits but not all we would have it perceived as an impure state. Here unpolarized light would have a coherency (density) matrix which is diagonal with both entries equal to 1/2. This is a completely mixed state and we can generate this by looking at the partial trace of a qubit which is paired with another qubit as the bell state $\\dfrac{|00\\rangle + |11\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}$. Hence we make use of $q_0$ as an ancillary qubit which is present as a bell pair with $q_1$ which is now the polarization qubit. $q_2$ is the parity qubit. As we can see since we do not measure the $q_0$ qubit we would actually see $q_1$ behave like a mixed state which is what the random rotator actually achieves. More specifically the bell state I have described has half probability for any state on the XZ plane of the bloch sphere and since the random rotator is a $R_yZ$ operation the system as a whole is essentially composed of all states on the XZ plane which would be described by observing one qubit out of this bell pair."

    "To fully realize quantum computing (or any form of computing) one needs a physical system capable of producing the minimal set of operations which can then be extended to a set of all possible operations and sequences of operations. In classical computers the complete set is realized using the set of operations $\\{\\lnot,\\land\\}$ or $\\{\\lnot,\\lor\\}$. For quantum computers universality would imply being able to make any circuit which essentially means the set of all unitary matrices. This of course is non inclusive of measurements (which will not keep a circuit unitary) but one can prove that measurements placed in the middle of a cicuit can be taken to the very end without affecting the final measurement probabilities (since once measured any qubit is essentially decohered and cannot be part of the circuit anyway). \n",
    "\n",
    "To get the complete set of unitary matrices we can first start for the case of a single qubit. This set would essentially be the $SU(2)$ group which is isomorphic to $SO(3)$ and given that we have an $R_x(\\theta)$ gate in form of the SLM we actually just need rotation about some other axis to achieve single qubit universality for parity. The polarization qubit does have a $R_y(\\theta)Z$ qubit which can be used to get the hadamard gate $H$ with $\\theta = \\pi/2$ and in combination with a quarter wave plate with fast axis horizontal we can actually make the HWP just be a pure $R_y(\\theta)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PS-SLM is an operator which controls the parity using the polarity and is essentially a controlled Rx gate and so can be made into a CNOT gate which adds an additional phase of $\\iota$ to the horizontal polarization component. To make the CNOT of the other way we can try for the MZI configuration proposed [here](#Proposal-for-a-Parity-Sensitive-Polarisation-Modifier). The point here is that once we have these two CNOTS, we can essentially get universal unitaries by swapping the polarization (see cell below) and parity qubit in such a way that we can apply an Rx gate followed by Ry and then another Rx with the appropriate euler angles and we can attain individual qubit universalities of $U3$ gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact swapping involves making use of a quarter wave plate which has the operator form of $e^{-\\iota\\pi/4}\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\\\0 & \\iota\\end{pmatrix}$ and also a new kind of SLM which does this same operation but on the parity qubit. \n",

    "## 7. Concluding Remarks\n",
    "The exceeding of $B_\\text{max}$ beyond the value of 2 in quantum mechanics implied that one cannot use locally deterministic hidden variable theories to explain quantum mechanics or simply put proves that quantum mechanics violates local realism. Here we have seen that $B_\\text{max}$ exceeds this classical limit and one can conclude equivalently that one cannot write the correlation function as some $C(\\theta_a,\\phi_a) = \\int d\\lambda\\rho(\\lambda)C_\\text{pol}(\\theta_a,\\lambda)C_\\text{par}(\\phi_a,\\lambda)$ where $\\lambda$ is some set of hidden variables. The proper proof of this is described in [Appendix A](#Appendix-A:-The-EPR-paradox-and-Bell's-inequalities) and the experimental results concur with this. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a way this shows that if one were to have two DoFs, there would be an uncertainty which arises due their coupling which is quantised by using the Bell's measure. These results would hold good regardless of the type of DoF used and can be extended to systems with a higher number of DoFs too. We also explored how one can link this with quantum systems and reproduced the results using a quantum computer simulation of IBM Q.\n",
    "\n",
    "More importantly one must take note of how looking at the coherency behaviors of the individual DoFs would not address the actual coherence it had since some of it would be 'shared' in form of coupling. In short the partial traces of coherency matrices offer an incomplete picture of the system quite similar to how one would deal with multi qubit systems and have the state behave mixed when only looking at the partial trace over a part of the Hilber space. We even took advantage of this incomplete picture to create mixed states in the previous section. This also demonstrates how one could effectively share coherence between two DoFs as seen in experiment B where the coherency $S_\\text{pol}$ of the polarization qubit is effectively increased at maximal entaglement with the fully coherent parity DoF."

I will discuss Bohm's variant since Bell's response was made in a way to that. Say we have prepared a electron-positron pair coming from a single source. These would be entangled in a way where if we measure the spin of one of the particles, the other particle will simultaneously collapse to the opposite spin.\n",

This makes it a non local effect which clearly does not make sense in a world which was believed to follow local realism. It can be proven that the two agents have no way to communicate using this pair hence showing that there actually is no faster than light comminication. While one may think choosing basis in a certain manner can change measurement probabilities and essentially have some \"information\" change, no matter how much measurements are done, since this is probabilistic the other agent cannot conclude anything from that.\n",

The bound above is shown to be 2 which is satisfied for classical systems and is violated for quantum mechanical correlations.

To prove this we can suppose we have four hermitian operators $A_0,A_1,B_0,B_1$ where $[A_i,B_j] = 0$ but the $[A_0,A_1] \\neq 0$ and $[B_0,B_1] \\neq 0$.

We know that for a simple spin system $[\\sigma\\cdot\\vec{a},\\sigma\\cdot\\vec{b}] = 2\\iota\\sigma\\cdot(\\vec{a}\\times\\vec{b})$. Now we will define a new operator called $\\mathcal{B}$\n",

We would infact have $\\mathcal{B}^2$ reach it's maximum if $A_0,B_0$ measures along $\\hat{x}$ and $A_1,B_1$ measures along $\\hat{y}$ which would make $\\mathcal{B}^2 = 8I$.
