    "## 1. Polarization & Spatial Parity\n",
    "\n",
    "In the paper \\[topic 2\\] the experiments which were done were made using of an optical beam model with two binary degrees of freedom, them being polarization and spatial parity along the $x$ direction respectively of a quasi monochromatic source.<br>\n",
    "For the spatial parity, in one dimension the beams are of form $E(x) = E_e\\psi_e(x)+E_o\\psi_o(x)$ where $\\psi_e(x)$ is an even function and $\\psi_o(x) = \\text{sgn}(x)\\psi_e(x)$ hence is an odd function. We give this beam a vector representation called $\\mathbf{J}_\\text{par} = [E_e\\text{ } E_o]^T$. Spatial paritt is manipulated using a spatial light modulator (SLM) which we describe in the experimental apparatus section. Along with the horizontal (H) and vertical components of polarization taken into account we describe the polarization-parity jones vector as $\\mathbf{J} = [E_\\text{He}\\text{ }E_\\text{Ho}\\text{ }E_\\text{Ve}\\text{ }E_\\text{Vo}]^T$.<br>\n",
    "We then describe the properties of this coherence using a $4\\times4$ matrix which is $\\mathbf{G} = \\langle\\mathbf{J}^{*}\\mathbf{J}^\\text{T}\\rangle$. Taking partial trace along $\\mathbf{G}$ would give us either $\\mathbf{G}_\\text{pol}$ or $\\mathbf{G}_\\text{par}$ on taking trace along parity or polarization respectively. We define a degree of polarization/parity using $D_{\\text{pol}}$($D_\\text{par}$) which quantifies the apparent coherence of each DoF when the other DoF is unresolved. Further an overall coherence $S$ is defined using the beam's linear entropy \\[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_entropy\\] as follows.\n",
    "The definition of linear entropy comes from the motivation of von Neumann Entropy. For a quantum mechanical system with a density matrix $\\rho$ this is defined as $S_v = \\text{Tr}(-\\rho\\ln(\\rho)) = -\\langle\\ln(\\rho)\\rangle$. The linear entropy $S_L$ is a lower approximation to $S_v$ which comes from expanding the leading term in the expansion of $\\rho\\ln\\rho$ which becomes $\\rho-\\rho^2$ approximately when $\\rho$ is close to $I$ (using taylor expansion) and taking trace this gives us the definition $S_L = \\text{Tr}(\\rho) - \\text{Tr}(\\rho^2)$ and by definition of the density matrix we have trace of $\\rho$ equal to 1 which gives us $S_L = 1 - \\text{Tr}(\\rho^2)$. This is a non normalized quantity so this is normalized by multiplying it by $\\frac{d}{d-1}$ which here is $4/3$ since our system has four dimensions. The definition of our $\\mathbf{G}$ matrix is isomorphic to the definition of a density matrix of a two qubit system keeping the Jones vector $\\mathbf{J}$ as the state of this two qubit system. Hence we have \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:1.1}\\tag{1.1}S = 1-S_L = 1 - \\frac{4}{3} + \\frac{4}{3}\\text{Tr}(\\mathbf{G}^2) = \\frac{4}{3}\\left(\\text{Tr}\\{\\mathbf{G}^2\\}-\\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\end{equation}\n",
    "We know that for normalized states we have that $\\frac{1}{d}\\leq$ Tr$(\\rho^2) \\leq 1$ and equals one only for a pure state and $1/d$ for completely mixed state. We can similarly draw a parallel here to seeing that $S=1$ happens only for coherent (pure) states and is 0 when completely incoherent. An important note to make here is that applying a unitary matrix $U$ (so $U^{*}U^{T} = I$) which is not time dependent on the Jones vector would not change our value of $S$ since on acting of a unitary we would have $\\mathbf{G}' = U^{*}\\mathbf{G}U^{T}$ and so $\\mathbf{G}'^2 = U^{*}\\mathbf{G}^2U^{T}$ and this has same trace as $\\mathbf{G}^2$ since trace is invariant under unitary transforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper here explores the properties of a beam where these two DoFs are infact coupled or entagled. One can start with a coherent linearly polarized beam at $45^\\circ$ with even polarity which would be $\\mathbf{J} = (1/\\sqrt{2})[\\text{1 0 1 0}]^T$ which can clearly be factored into a direct product of $\\mathbf{J}_{\\text{pol}}\\otimes\\mathbf{J}_\\text{par}$ and so $D_\\text{pol} = D_\\text{par} = 1$. However on passing this beam through a polarization sensitive SLM which introduces a phase of $\\varphi/2\\sin(\\varphi)$ only to the horizontal polarity component and none to the vertical. We can think of this analoguos to a controlled $R_x(\\varphi)$ operation from the polarization qubit to parity qubit which acts when polarization is $|0\\rangle$ (called H here for polarization). This puts the state to an entagled state $\\mathbf = (1/\\sqrt{2})[\\cos(\\varphi/2)\\text{ }\\iota\\sin(\\varphi/2)\\text{ 1 0}]^T$ which is no longer factorizable and shows that the apparant degree of coherence of the individual DoFs are no longer equal to 1 unless $\\varphi=0$ and infact equal zero when $\\varphi=\\pi$. However we know that this state is still coherent on an overall, the only issue is that seeing the partial trace of $\\mathbf{G}$ along the respective DoF provide an incomplete picture of the state hence leading to a conclusion that the coherence is absent. The paper proceeds to make use of the Bell's measure (see Appendix A) to quantify this entaglement which is the cause of this apparent coherence deficit."

    "For the experimental setup, we are using various separate components, which we will comment on one by one before seeing how they are arranged together for the experiment in this paper. We can develop a matrix operator formalism based on how these elements affect the vector $\\mathbf{J} = [E_{He} \\ E_{Ho} \\ E_{Ve} \\ E_{Vo}]$. Suppoe we have a device that modifies the Jones vector of a beam in the following way - $\\mathbf{J_{new}} = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{J_{old}}$. Then, the corresponding $\\mathbf{G} = \\langle \\mathbf{J^*J^T}\\rangle$ tranforms as $\\mathbf{G_{new} = A^*G_{old}A^T}$. This is because, assuming that the effect of the device, encoded in matrix $\\mathbf{A}$  is time independent, the matrix can just move inside the time average.

We can either correct this with a second reflection of that beam from a $45^\\circ$ mirror to correct it or not do anything at all about it (in the experimental setup in the paper seen as a whole, we can see that it won't matter the odd and even beams will be switched, but that is about it.)\n",

    "One thing about mirrors which is particularly inconvenient is that the incoming and outgoing beam does not travel in the same direction, so we cannot conveniently include a mirror in the arm of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer easily, for example. To make our life simple, we use a dove prism, which is a trapezoid shaped prism, that the light beam enters, undergoes TIR on one surface of it and exits travelling in the same direction as incoming beam. It performs the same matrix operation as a mirror, but is more convenient to use. One aspect to be careful of (that can be easily overcome) is that there is a phase change because the beam travels through the glass/ material of the prism, but that can be easily dealt with by using a compensator cell in the other arm. Aother important aspect of a Dove prism - since the wave incidence medium is denser and the transmission medium is rarer (unlike a regular mirror), there is no addition $\\pi$ phase of reflection, and the operator matrix is simply $$\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}e \\\\ o \\end{pmatrix}_{old} = \\begin{pmatrix}e \\\\ o \\end{pmatrix}_{new}$$\n",

Suppose the only input beam is given from In1. Then, the left beam suffers two rarer-denser reflections and the same is the case with the right beam, as they come out from Out2. Hence, we have constructive interference at Out2. Whereas, as Out1, the left beam still has same phase (the reflection at exit beam splitter is denser-rarer, so no phase change) while the right beam has one reflection only, so the interference is destructive.</p>\n",
    "<p>With a dove prism in place, the odd mode undergoes one extra inversion in the left path, so its constructive/destructive outputs are now exactly swapped. As a result, if we send in a superposition of odd and even modes into In1, the odd mode comes out from Out1, while the even mode comes out from Out2 (just as if no prism were there). Conversely, if we send in the beam from In2, the odd mode will come out from Out2 and the even mode from Out1.</p>\n",

    "A SLM is a spatial light modulator. In general, this term refers to any device that modifies the beam in a space dependent fashion. In the context of this experiment, the SLM they use (Hamamatsu X10468-02) is an array of liquid crystal pixels, each of whose refractive index can be controlled independently by applying a voltage, in such a way, that we add a desired phase to the light passing through each pixel, and the phase in each pixel is independent of the others.\n",
    "<p>Suppose we send a beam through a SLM which adds a $x$-dependant phase $\\frac{\\phi}{2}sgn(x)$ to the electric field (global phase does not matter here, by the way. Only relative phase/ difference in phase between top and bottom half being $\\phi$ is what matters.) Then, we are effectively multiplying the old profile $E_{old}(x)$ by $e^{\\iota\\frac{\\phi}{2}sgn(x)}$, to get new profile $E_{new}(x)$. Observe that $e^{\\iota\\frac{\\phi}{2}sgn(x)} = cos(\\frac{\\phi}{2})+ \\iota sgn(x)sin(\\frac{\\phi}{2})$. So, with $E_{old}(x) = e(x)+o(x)$, we can get $E_{new}(x) = (e(x)+o(x))(cos(\\phi/2)+\\iota sgn(x)sin(\\phi/2)) = [cos(\\phi/2)e(x) + \\iota sin(\\phi/2) sgn(x)o(x)] + [cos(\\phi/2)o(x) + \\iota sin(\\phi/2) sgn(x)e(x)]$. </p>\n",

In particular, observe that if we set $\\phi = \\pi$ then the matrix shown looks like a Pauli $\\sigma_x$ matrix (times the constant $\\iota$)- it swaps the $o$ and $e$ bases.\n",

    "<p> In the main paper, one of the loose ends that the authors do not seem to have addressed is that polarity seems to have a special place in this qubits scheme, in the sense that controlled gates can be made only with polarity as a control qubit (no parity controlled gates/devices are proposed). Here, we wish to present the design of a parity controlled device, that can be used to implement the controlled version of any possible (ordinarily) parity-insensitive device. \n",
    "<p>The main idea is to use the second use of the MZI. Suppose you are given an input beam and you want to perform a controlled-HWP operation on that (we have already seen uncontrolled HWP earlier). Then, the idea is to split up the input beam into the odd and even components with an MZI and then recombine them with a second MZI. In this way, a parity-controlled operation can be performed. The below image shows a schematic for a parity-sensitive HWP.</p>\n",
    "<img width = \"40%\" src='Parity_sensitive_HWP.png'>\n",
    "<p> An important use of this idea will be to bring the line of thought presented in the paper to a logical conclusion - suppose we start with a purely even mode but completely unpolarised beam. Then, by coupling the parity to the polarisation, we can generate a coupled-DOF beam. To convert this beam to a completely polarised, parity-incoherent beam, we would need to implement a parity-controlled polarisation operation, which this section proposes a theoretical solution to accomplishing. One major issue still here, is that stacking two MZI's could be a challenge, in view of the difficulty of alignment."

    "Before talking about the bell's measure let us first dive into why it was made and for this we must look at the EPR experiment proposed in \\[epr\\]. I will discuss Bohm's variant since Bell's response was made in a way to that. Say we have prepared a electron-positron pair coming from a single source. These would be entangled in a way where if we measure the spin of one of the particles, the other particle will simultaneously collapse to the opposite spin.\n",

    "So the main issue which Einstein had was that this means that measurement on one particle directly affects the other no matter how far it is. This makes it a non local effect which clearly does not make sense in a world which was believed to follow local realism. It can be proven that the two agents have no way to communicate using this pair hence showing that there actually is no faster than light comminication. While one may think choosing basis in a certain manner can change measurement probabilities and essentially have some \"information\" change, no matter how much measurements are done, since this is probabilistic the other agent cannot conclude anything from that.\n",
