    "### The EPR paradox and Bell's inequalities\n",
    "\n",
    "Before talking about the bell's measure let us first dive into why it was made and for this we must look at the EPR experiment proposed in \\[epr\\]. The EPR paradox starts off with considering two entagled particles present in a two particle state. We label the state as $\\Psi(x_1,x_2) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\psi_n(x_2)u_n(x_1)$ here we merely regard $\\psi_n(x_2)$ as coefficients for $\\Psi$ when expanded in the $u_n(x_2)$ basis for some operator $A$ for which those are the eigenvectors. However if we pick a different operator $B$ which has we can get a different expansion with respect to it's eigenvalues which lets suppose to be $v_s(x_1)$ so we get $\\Psi(x_1,x_2) = \\sum_{s=1}^{\\infty}\\phi_s(x_2)v_s(x_1)$. \n",
    "Now the real issue is when we take $A$ and $B$ to be non commutative. The example in this paper is taking $P = (h/2\\pi\\iota)\\partial/\\partial{x_2}$ and $Q = x_2$ which do not commute so in the case where we choose either of these measurements, we affect the other particle in a way where we can change it's state just by our choice hence this goes against local realism and is the \"spooky\" action at distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there have been multiple responses to this, the most important one is the one discussed in Bell's paper \\[bell\\].\n",
    "First we will start by considering the EPR argument using spin particles. Consider a pair of spin one-half particles formed somehow in the singlet spin state and moving freely in opposite directions. Measurements can be made, say by Stern-Gerlach magnets, on selected components of the spins $\\vec{\\sigma_1}$ and $\\vec{\\sigma_2}$,\n",
    "If measurement of the component $\\vec{\\sigma_1}\\cdot{a}$, where $a$ is some unit vector, yields the value +1 then, according to quantum mechanics, measurement of $\\vec{\\sigma_2}\\cdot{a}$ must yield the value -1 and vice versa.\n",
    "We now define some set of parameters $\\lambda$ which is taken as continuous which give us a complete description of the state. The result $A$ of measuring $\\vec{\\sigma_1}\\cdot{a}$ is then determined by $a$ and $\\lambda$, and the result $B$ of measuring $\\vec{\\sigma_2}\\cdot{b}$ in the\n",
    "same instance is determined by $b$ and $\\lambda$.\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:1}\\tag{1}A(\\vec{a},\\lambda) = \\pm 1, B(\\vec{b},\\lambda) = \\pm 1 \\end{equation}\n",
    "We now take $\\rho(\\lambda)$ as the probability distribution of $\\lambda$ and we will now try to find the expectation value of of the product of the two components $\\vec{\\sigma_1}\\cdot{a}$ and $\\vec{\\sigma_2}\\cdot{b}$.\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:2}\\tag{2}P(\\vec{a}\\vec{b}) = \\int{d\\lambda}\\rho{\\lambda}A(\\vec{a},\\lambda)B(\\vec{b},\\lambda)\\end{equation}\n",
    "The quantum mechanical expectation value of this is the following\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:3}\\tag{3}\\langle\\vec{\\sigma_1}\\cdot{a}\\vec{\\sigma_2}\\cdot{b}\\rangle = - \\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}\\end{equation}\n",
    "However it turns out that eq: \\ref{eq:2} doesn't give us the same result as \\ref{eq:3}. So first off we know that we have a normalized distribution.\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:4}\\tag{4}\\int{d\\lambda}\\rho(\\lambda) = 1\\end{equation}\n",
    "if we take $\\vec{a} = \\vec{b}$ the $P$ in eq: \\ref{eq:2} can reach -1.\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:5}\\tag{5}A(\\vec{a},\\lambda) = -B(\\vec{a},\\lambda)\\end{equation}\n",
    "Knowing this we can rewrite eq: \\ref{eq:2} into the following\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:6}\\tag{6}P(\\vec{a}\\vec{b}) = -\\int{d\\lambda}\\rho{\\lambda}A(\\vec{a},\\lambda)A(\\vec{b},\\lambda)\\end{equation}\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:7}\\tag{7}P(\\vec{a},\\vec{b}) - P(\\vec{a},\\vec{c}) = \\int{d\\lambda}\\rho{\\lambda}[1-A(\\vec{b},\\lambda)A(\\vec{c},\\lambda)]\\end{equation}\n",
    "from eq: \\ref{eq:1} we can write this\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:8}\\tag{8}|P(\\vec{a},\\vec{b}) - P(\\vec{a},\\vec{c})| \\leq \\int{d\\lambda}\\rho{\\lambda}A(\\vec{a},\\lambda)A(\\vec{b},\\lambda)[A(\\vec{b},\\lambda)A(\\vec{c},\\lambda) - 1]\\end{equation}\n",
    "The second term on the right is just $P(\\vec{b},\\vec{c})$ so we get\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:9}\\tag{9}1 + P(\\vec{b},\\vec{c}) \\geq |P(\\vec{a},\\vec{b}) - P(\\vec{a},\\vec{c})|\\end{equation}\n",
    "Now we define a $\\overline{P}(\\vec{a},\\vec{b})$ and a $\\overline{- \\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}}$ which essentially are the averages over vectors differing from a small angle from $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ of the quantities under the bar. Let's suppose the following holds for some $\\epsilon$\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:10}\\tag{10}|\\overline{P}(\\vec{a},\\vec{b}) + \\overline{\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}}| \\leq \\epsilon\\end{equation}\n",
    "We cannot make $\\epsilon$ arbitrarily small and this can be proven by the following steps. Let us first assume the following inequality holds for all $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:11}\\tag{11}|\\overline{\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}} - \\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}| \\leq\\delta\\end{equation}\n",
    "Then using eq:\\ref{eq:11} and eq:\\ref{eq:10} we have\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:12}\\tag{12}|\\overline{P}(\\vec{a},\\vec{b}) + \\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b}| \\leq \\epsilon + \\delta\\end{equation}\n",
    "Now taking $\\vec{a} = \\vec{b}$ (hence their dot product is 1) we rewrite eq:\\ref{eq:12} as the equation below while using the fact that $\\overline{P(\\vec{a},\\vec{b})} = \\int d\\lambda\\rho(\\lambda)\\overline{A}(\\vec{a},\\lambda)\\overline{B}(\\vec{b},\\lambda))$.\n",

    "We can extend from \\ref{eq:1} that on averaging over a small range, $|\\overline{A}(\\vec{a},\\lambda)| \\leq 1$ and $|\\overline{B}(\\vec{b},\\lambda)| \\leq 1$. Now we can write the following\n",

    "Using the inequalities on the averaged $A$ and $B$ we can write the following\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:15}\\tag{15}|\\overline{P}(\\vec{a},\\vec{b})-\\overline{P}(\\vec{b},\\vec{c})| \\leq \\int{d\\lambda}\\rho{\\lambda}[\\overline{A}(\\vec{b},\\lambda)\\overline{B}(\\vec{c},\\lambda) + 1] - \\int{d\\lambda}\\rho{\\lambda}[\\overline{A}(\\vec{b},\\lambda)\\overline{B}(\\vec{b},\\lambda) + 1]\\end{equation}\n",

    "We write eq:\\ref{eq:16} using eq:\\ref{eq:15} and eq:\\ref{eq:13}. Finally using eq:\\ref{eq:12} we rewrite the above equation as\n",

    "Now with the constraint coming from eq:\\ref{eq:17} we can handpick values of $\\vec{a},\\vec{b},\\vec{c}$ such that $\\epsilon$ cannot be made arbitrarily small (take $\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{b} = \\vec{c}\\cdot\\vec{b} = 1/\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{c} = 0$ this would show $4(\\epsilon+\\delta)\\geq\\sqrt{2}-1$). The fact that $\\epsilon$ cannot be made arbitrarily small implies that the quantum mechanical value cannot be approximated either accurately or arbitrarily close to this form using hidden variable. So this contradiction implies that some assumptions that we have taken happen to not work together and that happen to be local determinism and hidden variables. So any hidden variable theory by nature itself is non local."

    "## Polarization & Spatial Parity\n",
    "\n",
    "In the paper \\[topic 2\\] the experiments which were done were made using of an optical beam model with two binary degrees of freedom, them being polarization and spatial parity along the $x$ direction respectively of a quasi monochromatic source.<br>\n",
    "For the spatial parity, in one dimension the beams are of form $E(x) = E_e\\psi_e(x)+E_o\\psi_o(x)$ where $\\psi_e(x)$ is an even function and $\\psi_o(x) = \\text{sgn}(x)\\psi_e(x)$ hence is an odd function. We give this beam a vector representation called $\\mathbf{J}_\\text{par} = [E_e\\text{ } E_o]^T$. Spatial paritt is manipulated using a spatial light modulator (SLM) which we describe in the experimental apparatus section. Along with the horizontal (H) and vertical components of polarization taken into account we describe the polarization-parity jones vector as $\\mathbf{J} = [E_\\text{He}\\text{ }E_\\text{Ho}\\text{ }E_\\text{Ve}\\text{ }E_\\text{Vo}]$.<br>\n",
    "We then describe the properties of this coherence using a $4\\times4$ matrix which is $\\mathbf{G} = \\langle\\mathbf{J}*\\mathbf{J}^\\text{T}\\rangle$. Taking partial trace along $\\mathbf{G}$ would give us either $\\mathbf{G}_\\text{pol}$ or $\\mathbf{G}_\\text{par}$ on taking trace along parity or polarization respectively."
