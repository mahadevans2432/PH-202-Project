    "For the experimental setup, we are using various separate components, which we will comment on one by one before seeing how they are arranged together for the experiment in this paper. We can develop a matrix operator formalism based on how these elements affect the vector $\\mathbf{J} = [E_{He} \\ E_{Ho} \\ E_{Ve} \\ E_{Vo}]$. Suppoe we have a device that modifies the Jones vector of a beam in the following way - $\\mathbf{J_{new}} = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{J_{old}}$. Then, the corresponding $\\mathbf{G} = \\langle \\mathbf{J^*J^T}\\rangle$ tranforms as $\\mathbf{G_{new} = A^*G_{old}A^T}$. This is because, assuming that the effect of the device, encoded in matrix $\\mathbf{A}$  is time independent, the matrix can just move inside the time average. And as we will see below, for all the devices used in this experiment, their effect is time invariant."

It performs the same matrix operation as a mirror, but is more convenient to use. One aspect to be careful of (that can be easily overcome) is that there is a phase change because the beam travels through the glass/ material of the prism, but that can be easily dealt with by using a compensator cell in the other arm. Aother important aspect of a Dove prism - since the wave incidence medium is denser and the transmission medium is rarer (unlike a regular mirror), there is no addition $\\pi$ phase of reflection, and the operator matrix is simply $$\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}e \\\\ o \\end{pmatrix}_{old} = \\begin{pmatrix}e \\\\ o \\end{pmatrix}_{new}$$\n",
