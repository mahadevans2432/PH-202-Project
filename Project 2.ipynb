    "## Introduction\n",
    "Bell states or entangled states are a very common idea in the realm of quantum computing. The idea behind a bell state is that the measurement of one qubit is perfectly correlated to the measurement of the other. So while a partial measurement of only one qubit would lead the observer to believe that the state is not pure (the quantum computing equivalent of coherence in optics), the state is infact pure when a correlated measurement of the two qubits is carried out at the same time. This has interesting applications such as quantum teleportation, superdense coding and quantum cryptography. While bell states have been studied thoroughly in the field of quantum computing, there are not many studies that explore the classical analogue of bell states. In this project, we have tried to explore the this topic mainly along the ideas presented in reference [[1](#ref-1)]. \n",
    "<p> The main idea we are trying to explore is that it is possible to couple two degrees of freedom (DOFs) of a beam of light, in the context of our discussion, polarisation and parity, such that when a measurement of only one DOF is made (independent of the other), it is possible for the beam to appear partially coherent or even completely incoherent, while the the beam is infact completely coherent (in the sense that there is nothing 'random' about the beam). This hidden coupling can be made evident by actually performing a correlated bell state measurement between the two DOFs, and also allows us to distinguish true randomness (partial coherence) from entanglement. It is also possible to look at coherence as a resource that can be shared among different DOFs, for example, we can start with a completely unpolarised beam which is parity coherent, and convert it to a beam which is perfectly polarised but parity incoherent. Further, we have tried to explore the relevance of this scheme to a classical implementation of a quantum computer, which can infact be shown to be universal, but is limited in the fact that the scheme is hard to generalise to a large number of qubits. </p> "

    "## 1. Polarization & Spatial Parity\n",
    "\n",
    "In the paper [[1](#ref-1)] the experiments which were done were made using of an optical beam model with two binary degrees of freedom, specifically polarization and spatial parity along the $x$ direction (vertically upwards) respectively of a quasi monochromatic source, where the beam is travelling in the $z$ direction.<br>\n",
    "For the spatial parity, in one dimension the beams are of form $E(x) = E_e\\psi_e(x)+E_o\\psi_o(x)$ where $\\psi_e(x)$ is an even function and $\\psi_o(x) = \\text{sgn}(x)\\psi_e(x)$ hence is an odd function. We give this beam a vector representation called $\\mathbf{J}_\\text{par} = [E_e\\text{ } E_o]^T$. Spatial parity is manipulated using a spatial light modulator (SLM) which we describe in the experimental apparatus section. Along with the horizontal (H) and vertical components of polarization taken into account we describe the polarization-parity jones vector as $\\mathbf{J} = [E_\\text{He}\\text{ }E_\\text{Ho}\\text{ }E_\\text{Ve}\\text{ }E_\\text{Vo}]^T$.<br>\n",
    "We then describe the properties of this coherence using a $4\\times4$ matrix which is $\\mathbf{G} = \\langle\\mathbf{J}^{*}\\mathbf{J}^\\text{T}\\rangle$. Taking partial trace along $\\mathbf{G}$ would give us either $\\mathbf{G}_\\text{pol}$ or $\\mathbf{G}_\\text{par}$ on taking trace along parity or polarization respectively. We define a degree of polarization/parity using $D_{\\text{pol}}$($D_\\text{par}$) which quantifies the apparent coherence of each DoF when the other DoF is unresolved. Further an overall coherence $S$ is defined using the beam's linear entropy [[2](#ref-2)] as follows.\n",
    "The definition of linear entropy comes from the motivation of von Neumann Entropy. For a quantum mechanical system with a density matrix $\\rho$ this is defined as $S_v = \\text{Tr}(-\\rho\\ln(\\rho)) = -\\langle\\ln(\\rho)\\rangle$. The linear entropy $S_L$ is a lower approximation to $S_v$ which comes from expanding the leading term in the expansion of $\\rho\\ln\\rho$ which becomes $\\rho-\\rho^2$ approximately when $\\rho$ is close to $I$ (using taylor expansion) and taking trace this gives us the definition $S_L = \\text{Tr}(\\rho) - \\text{Tr}(\\rho^2)$ and by definition of the density matrix we have trace of $\\rho$ equal to 1 which gives us $S_L = 1 - \\text{Tr}(\\rho^2)$. This is a non normalized quantity so this is normalized by multiplying it by $\\frac{d}{d-1}$ which here is $4/3$ since our system has four dimensions. The definition of our $\\mathbf{G}$ matrix is isomorphic to the definition of a density matrix of a two qubit system keeping the Jones vector $\\mathbf{J}$ as the state of this two qubit system. Hence we have \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:1.1}\\tag{1.1}S = 1-S_L = 1 - \\frac{4}{3} + \\frac{4}{3}\\text{Tr}(\\mathbf{G}^2) = \\frac{4}{3}\\left(\\text{Tr}\\{\\mathbf{G}^2\\}-\\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\end{equation}\n",
    "We know that for normalized states we have that $\\frac{1}{d}\\leq$ Tr$(\\rho^2) \\leq 1$ and equals one only for a pure state and $1/d$ for completely mixed state. We can similarly draw a parallel here to seeing that $S=1$ happens only for coherent (pure) states and is 0 when completely incoherent. An important note to make here is that applying a unitary matrix $U$ (so $U^{*}U^{T} = I$) which is not time dependent on the Jones vector would not change our value of $S$ since on acting of a unitary we would have $\\mathbf{G}' = U^{*}\\mathbf{G}U^{T}$ and so $\\mathbf{G}'^2 = U^{*}\\mathbf{G}^2U^{T}$ and this has same trace as $\\mathbf{G}^2$ since trace is invariant under unitary transforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper here explores the properties of a beam where these two DoFs are infact coupled or entagled. One can start with a coherent linearly polarized beam at $45^\\circ$ with even polarity which would be $\\mathbf{J} = (1/\\sqrt{2})[\\text{1 0 1 0}]^T$ which can clearly be factored into a direct product of $\\mathbf{J}_{\\text{pol}}\\otimes\\mathbf{J}_\\text{par}$ and so $D_\\text{pol} = D_\\text{par} = 1$. However on passing this beam through a polarization sensitive SLM which introduces a phase of $\\varphi/2\\sin(\\varphi)$ only to the horizontal polarity component and none to the vertical. We can think of this analoguos to a controlled $R_x(\\varphi)$ operation from the polarization qubit to parity qubit which acts when polarization is $|0\\rangle$ (called H here for polarization). This puts the state to an entagled state $\\mathbf{J} = (1/\\sqrt{2})[\\cos(\\varphi/2)\\text{ }\\iota\\sin(\\varphi/2)\\text{ 1 0}]^T$ which is no longer factorizable and shows that the apparant degree of coherence of the individual DoFs are no longer equal to 1 unless $\\varphi=0$ and infact equal zero when $\\varphi=\\pi$. However we know that this state is still coherent on an overall, the only issue is that seeing the partial trace of $\\mathbf{G}$ along the respective DoF provide an incomplete picture of the state hence leading to a conclusion that the coherence is absent. The paper proceeds to make use of the Bell's measure (see [Appendix A](#Appendix-A:-The-EPR-paradox-and-Bell's-inequalities)) to quantify this entanglement which is the cause of this apparent coherence deficit."

We can develop a matrix operator formalism based on how these elements affect the vector $\\mathbf{J} = [E_{He} \\ E_{Ho} \\ E_{Ve} \\ E_{Vo}]^T$. Suppoe we have a device that modifies the Jones vector of a beam in the following way - $\\mathbf{J_{new}} = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{J_{old}}$. Then, the corresponding $\\mathbf{G} = \\langle \\mathbf{J^*J^T}\\rangle$ tranforms as $\\mathbf{G_{new} = A^*G_{old}A^T}$.

We can either correct this with a second reflection of that beam from a $45^\\circ$ mirror to correct it or not do anything at all about it (in the experimental setup in the paper seen as a whole, we can see that it won't matter the odd and even beams will be switched, but that is about it.)\n",

It performs the same matrix operation as a mirror, but is more convenient to use. One aspect to be careful of (that can be easily overcome) is that there is a phase change because the beam travels through the glass/ material of the prism, but that can be easily dealt with by using a compensator cell in the other arm. Another important aspect of a Dove prism - since the wave incidence medium is denser and the transmission medium is rarer (unlike a regular mirror), there is no addition $\\pi$ phase of reflection, and the operator matrix is simply $$\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}e \\\\ o \\end{pmatrix}_{old} = \\begin{pmatrix}e \\\\ o \\end{pmatrix}_{new}$$\n",

Hence, we have constructive interference at Out2.

Only relative phase/ difference in phase between top and bottom half being $\\phi$ is what matters.) Then, we are effectively multiplying the old profile $E_{old}(x)$ by $e^{\\iota\\frac{\\phi}{2}sgn(x)}$, to get new profile $E_{new}(x)$. Observe that $e^{\\iota\\frac{\\phi}{2}sgn(x)} = cos(\\frac{\\phi}{2})+ \\iota sgn(x)sin(\\frac{\\phi}{2})$.

    "In the main paper [[1](#ref-1)], one of the loose ends that the authors do not seem to have addressed is that polarity seems to have a special place in this qubits scheme, in the sense that controlled gates can be made only with polarity as a control qubit (no parity controlled gates/devices are proposed). Here, we wish to present the design of a parity controlled device, that can be used to implement the controlled version of any possible (ordinarily) parity-insensitive device. \n",
    "<p>The main idea is to use the second use of the MZI. Suppose you are given an input beam and you want to perform a controlled-HWP operation on that (we have already seen uncontrolled HWP earlier). Then, the idea is to split up the input beam into the odd and even components with an MZI and then recombine them with a second MZI. In this way, a parity-controlled operation can be performed. The below image shows a schematic for a parity-sensitive HWP.</p>\n",

    "<p> An important use of this idea will be to bring the line of thought presented in the paper to a logical conclusion - suppose we start with a purely even mode but completely unpolarised beam. Then, by coupling the parity to the polarisation, we can generate a coupled-DOF beam. To convert this beam to a completely polarised, parity-incoherent beam, we would need to implement a parity-controlled polarisation operation, which this section proposes a theoretical solution to accomplishing. One major issue still here, is that stacking two MZI's could be a challenge, in view of the difficulty of alignment.This might be fixable by using waveguides </p>\n",

    "## The Three Experiments\n",

    "### Experiment A\n",
    "In experiment A, the authors of [[1](#ref-1)] use a laser source with a perfectly even amplitude function and perfectly linearly polarised in a direction $45^\\circ$ to the x - axis. Then it is passed through a PS-SLM inducing a phase $\\frac{\\phi}{2}sgn(x)$ only to the H-polarisation, but not to the V-polarisation. This is a classical bell state where polarisation and parity are coupled, and in the case where $\\phi = \\pi$ radians, both DOFs appear completely incoherent in an uncoupled measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experiment B\n",
    "In this experiment, the even mode $45^\\circ$ laser is first passed through a random rotator which makes the beam completely polarisation incoherent (unpolarised) while not affecting the parity coherence. Now, it is again passed through a PS-SLM like in experiment A. Thus, the parity DOF is coupled to the polarisation DOF, which is incoherent. With a complete coupling ($\\phi = \\pi$ radians) the parity as well as polarisation appear completely incoherent by themselves, while we expect the beam to infact be partially coherent, since it was parity coherent to begin with. This is again revealed to be true by a Bell-state measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experiment C\n",
    "In this experiment we pass the even mode $45^\\circ$ laser through a PS-SLM, but this time the PS-SLM is probabilistic, in the sense that it couples the parity to polarisation with probability $P$ and does not couple them, with a probability $1-P$ (i.e. the beam is unaffected). In this case, the PS-SLM itself contributes to the incoherence (partial) of the beam because it introduces an element of randomness. "

The polarization is analyzed in a linear basis rotated by $\\theta_a$ by action of the half wave plate and similarly the parity is analyzed by analyzing over a basis rotated by $\\varphi_a$. The measured intensities are normalized and kept as probabilities in a way that $P_H + P_V = P_o + P_e = 1$. In fig: 3.2 combined polarization-parity measurements are done by essentially using the setup of fig: 3.1 but by concatenating the different DoF analysis stages.

    "For the uncoupled case this can be factorized into $C(\\theta_1,\\varphi_a) = C_\\text{pol}(\\theta_a)C_\\text{par}(\\phi_a)$ and here we would have $C_\\text{pol}(\\theta_a) = P_H - P_V$ and $C_\\text{par} = P_e - P_o$.

    "\n",
    "We will now prove that any coherent beam has $D_\\text{pol} = D_\\text{par}$. Any coherent beam here would be isomorphic to a pure two qubit state. For pure states, if the state is $|\\psi\\rangle$, then the density matrix is $\\rho = |\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi|$. We can represent this in a Schmidt form where $|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_ig_i|u_i\\rangle\\otimes|v_i\\rangle$ which can be done for any arbitrary pure state so for the 4 dimensional Jones vector here we only have two variables and so without loss of generality we can choose to write our jones vector as $\\mathbf{J} = [\\mu_1\\text{ 0 0 }\\mu_2]^T$ and for this state we would have that\n",

Note that the above equation would be true in the basis where we can write the Schmidt decomposition of the Jones vector but since this is a coherent state this basis can be reached by applying unitaries that do not do any coupling. Also for coherent beams the paper claims that we would have $4D_\\text{par}^2+B_{max}^2 = 4D_\\text{pol}^2+B_{max}^2 = 8$ which becomes $4D_\\text{pol}^2+B_{max}^2\\leq 8$ and $4D_\\text{par}^2+B_{max}^2\\leq 8$ for partially coherent beams hence they define a new degree of coherence reffered to as the partial degree of coherence\n",

    "One important thing to note is that the accessible degrees of coherence written above are invariant under unitary coupling between the two DoFs. We can see this as a sort of sharing of coherence between apparent coherence of an individual DoF ($D_\\text{pol}$ and $D_\\text{par}$) and the coupling between them ($B_{max}$). For a fully coherent beam we will always have $S = S_\\text{pol} = S_\\text{par} = 1$ regardless of coupling between the DoFs. This also demostrates how we can make coherence essentially migrate from form of coupling to apparent coherence of individual DoFs by simply using unitary transforms.\n"

    "Secondly, for given values of $S_{pol}$ and $S_{par}$ for a partially coherent beam, we can predict the overall degree of coherence of the beam $S$ by drawing a line segment parallel to the $S$ axis contained within the figure, which gives us a narrow range within which $S$ must be for the beam. The paper suggests that the uncertainty in determining $S$ using this method is $\\sim6\\%$ on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall purpose of generating the figure was to show that we cannot have all combinations of $S$, $S_{pol}$, $S_{par}$ inside the unit cube in the first octant but only the ones which satisfy Bell's Inequality, which results in the obtained figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our attempt to generate the figure, we have essentially constructed a Monte-Carlo simulation with $10^5$ points based on the discussion in [[8](#ref-8)].<br>\n",
    "Since eigenvalues of G have to be real, positive and their sum must be 1, we first generate a diagonal matrix $D$ of the eigenvalues with the contraints applied. Now, to obtain a random G, we must first obtain a random unitary matrix $U$ and apply the following transformation on the diagonal matrix $D$.<br>\n",
    "<center>$G=UDU^{\\dagger}$</center>\n",
    "We obtain $U$ by first generating a random matrix and then QR factorizing it. Since Q is unitary, we have in essence found a random unitary matrix. The above set of operations is implemented in the function <code>randG()</code>.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "After this, we proceed to define the function  <code>C_ta_pa()</code> which calculates the correlation function for a given matrix $G$ with the parameters $t_{1} (\\theta_{a})$ and $p_{1} (\\phi_{a})$. The Bell Measure is calculated by the function  <code>B()</code> by making calls to the function <code>C_ta_pa()</code>.<br>\n",
    "Now, the calculation of the value $S$ is straightforward from the matrix $G$ and that of $D_{pol}$ and $D_{par}$ is also relatively straightforward once the matrices $G_{pol}$ and $G_{par}$ have been constructed. But, for the calculation of $S_{pol}$ and $S_{par}$, we need to determine the value $B_{max}$ first. Since there was no way the optimization of $10^5$ matrices could've been tensorized, we calculate this in loop for all the G matrices and that is what constitutes the bulk of the running time of the program. We implement this in the function  <code>genS()</code> below."

Here we make use of an ancillary qubit which is coupled with the rest of the two qubits and hence is in a way storing the coherence we wished to get rid off as part of it's coupling. The main idea of this paper was that partial trace matrices do not give us the complete picture of the system which we can demonstrate very simply just by using a bell state (a pure state) and noting that it's partial traces are actually representative of impure states.\n",

The measurement done in the end uses the statevector simulator of qiskit to directly calculate probabilities based on the state of the system. While running multiple shots using one of the real quantum computers one can access using IBM-Q would have been more impressive, those will come with heavy noise outputs would require additional noise and error mitigation procedures."

    "Here in the experiment a random rotator is used to generate what would be measured as unpolarized light. As stated before the coherence of a the DoFs are analogous to a qubit being in a mixed or pure state. Since we are working with idealized qubits the state of the system will always remain pure however if one were to look into just the hilbert space of few of the qubits but not all we would have it perceived as an impure state. Here unpolarized light would have a coherency (density) matrix which is diagonal with both entries equal to 1/2. This is a completely mixed state and we can generate this by looking at the partial trace of a qubit which is paired with another qubit as the bell state $\\dfrac{|00\\rangle + |11\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}$. Hence we make use of $q_0$ as an ancillary qubit which is present as a bell pair with $q_1$ which is now the polarization qubit. $q_2$ is the parity qubit. As we can see since we do not measure the $q_0$ qubit we would actually see $q_1$ behave like a mixed state which is what the random rotator actually achieves. More specifically the bell state we have described has half probability for any state on the XZ plane of the bloch sphere and since the random rotator is a $R_yZ$ operation the system as a whole is essentially composed of all states on the XZ plane which would be described by observing one qubit out of this bell pair."

    "### Universality using optical components\n",
    "Our main reference for this is [[3](#ref-3)]. To fully realize quantum computing (or any form of computing) one needs a physical system capable of producing the minimal set of operations which can then be extended to a set of all possible operations and sequences of operations. In classical computers the complete set is realized using the set of operations $\\{\\lnot,\\land\\}$ or $\\{\\lnot,\\lor\\}$. For quantum computers universality would imply being able to make any circuit which essentially means the set of all unitary matrices. This of course is non inclusive of measurements (which will not keep a circuit unitary) but one can prove that measurements placed in the middle of a cicuit can be taken to the very end without affecting the final measurement probabilities (since once measured any qubit is essentially decohered and cannot be part of the circuit anyway). \n",
    "\n",
    "To get the complete set of unitary matrices we can first start for the case of a single qubit. This set would essentially be the $SU(2)$ group which is isomorphic to $SO(3)$ and given that we have an $R_x(\\theta)$ gate in form of the SLM we actually just need rotation about some other axis to achieve single qubit universality for parity. The polarization qubit does have a $R_y(\\theta)Z$ qubit which can be used to get the hadamard gate $H$ with $\\theta = \\pi/2$ and in combination with a quarter wave plate with fast axis horizontal which is effectively the square root of $Z$ denoted with an $S$ (ignoring global phase) we can actually make the HWP just be a pure $R_y(\\theta)$. Additionally using $\\theta=\\pi$ we can make this into an $X$ gate ignoring global phase. The importance of this $X$ gate is that if we apply the gate sequence $X$-PSSLM-$X$ it is effectively a PSSLM which applies the operation of the SLM when the polarization is vertical which transalates exactly into a controlled $R_x(\\phi)$ operation which we will use in our analysis below. \n",
    "\n",
    "The PS-SLM is an operator which controls the parity using the polarity and is essentially a controlled Rx gate and so can be made into a CNOT gate which adds an additional phase of $\\iota$ to the horizontal polarization component. To make the CNOT of the other way we can try for the MZI configuration proposed [here](#Proposal-for-a-Parity-Sensitive-Polarisation-Modifier). The point here is that once we have these two CNOTS, we can essentially get universal unitaries by swapping the polarization (see cells below) and parity qubit in such a way that we can apply an Rx gate followed by Ry and then another Rx with the appropriate euler angles and we can attain individual qubit universalities of $U3$ gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact CNOT operation where polarization is control and parity is target involves making use of a quarter wave plate which has the operator form of $e^{-\\iota\\pi/4}\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\\\0 & \\iota\\end{pmatrix}$ on the polarization qubit so that we can induce a relative phase between H and V of polarization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now for getting overall universality we just need the CNOT gates of both ways and since we already have that using the PSSLM and the MZI setup described previously we actually have a universal quantum computer of two qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "A small note to be made is that the U3 gates have unique euler angles upto a global phase being ignored. Now we have established that global phase is useless here for a 1 qubit case but with two qubits a controlled-$U$ gate has importance on global phase of $U$. To tackle this we can simply make use of the decomposition of $U$ such that first a controlled $\\tilde{U}$ where $\\tilde{U}$ can be written as just the rotations ($R_y(\\theta_3)R_x(\\theta_2)R_y(\\theta_1)$ or $R_x(\\theta_3)R_y(\\theta_2)R_x(\\theta_1)$ depending on the qubit) ignoring the global phase and say $U=e^{\\iota\\alpha}\\tilde{U}$ we simply apply the gate equivalent to $R_z(\\alpha/2)$ to the control qubit. While applying this $z$ rotation we just introduce a relative phase of $\\alpha$ between the $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ of the control qubit which is equivalent to a controlled $U$ if done after the controlled $\\tilde{U}$. Note that global phase of this last gate does not concern us since that is global for both qubits unlike a controlled gate. "

We take the euler angles for $Y-X-Y$ and first apply $R_y$ on polarization, swap with parity and apply a $R_x$ on parity after that.

    "## 7. Concluding Remarks\n",
    "The exceeding of $B_\\text{max}$ beyond the value of 2 in quantum mechanics implied that one cannot use locally deterministic hidden variable theories to explain quantum mechanics or simply put proves that quantum mechanics violates local realism. Here we have seen that $B_\\text{max}$ exceeds this classical limit and one can conclude equivalently that one cannot write the correlation function as some $C(\\theta_a,\\phi_a) = \\int d\\lambda\\rho(\\lambda)C_\\text{pol}(\\theta_a,\\lambda)C_\\text{par}(\\phi_a,\\lambda)$ where $\\lambda$ is some set of hidden variables. The proper proof of this is described in [Appendix A](#Appendix-A:-The-EPR-paradox-and-Bell's-inequalities) and the experimental results concur with this. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a way this shows that if one were to have two DoFs, there would be an uncertainty which arises due their coupling which is quantised by using the Bell's measure. These results would hold good regardless of the type of DoF used and can be extended to systems with a higher number of DoFs too. We also explored how one can link this with quantum systems and reproduced the results using a quantum computer simulation of IBM Q.\n",
    "\n",
    "More importantly one must take note of how looking at the coherency behaviors of the individual DoFs would not address the actual coherence it had since some of it would be 'shared' in form of coupling. In short the partial traces of coherency matrices offer an incomplete picture of the system quite similar to how one would deal with multi qubit systems and have the state behave mixed when only looking at the partial trace over a part of the Hilber space. We even took advantage of this incomplete picture to create mixed states in the previous section. This also demonstrates how one could effectively share coherence between two DoFs as seen in experiment B where the coherency $S_\\text{pol}$ of the polarization qubit is effectively increased at maximal entaglement with the fully coherent parity DoF."

I will discuss Bohm's variant since Bell's response was made in a way to that. Say we have prepared a electron-positron pair coming from a single source. These would be entangled in a way where if we measure the spin of one of the particles, the other particle will simultaneously collapse to the opposite spin.\n",

This makes it a non local effect which clearly does not make sense in a world which was believed to follow local realism. It can be proven that the two agents have no way to communicate using this pair hence showing that there actually is no faster than light comminication. While one may think choosing basis in a certain manner can change measurement probabilities and essentially have some \"information\" change, no matter how much measurements are done, since this is probabilistic the other agent cannot conclude anything from that.\n",

    "The above inequality is the form of writing the CHSH inequalities [[6](#ref-6)]. The bound above is shown to be 2 which is satisfied for classical systems and is violated for quantum mechanical correlations. One can instead prove a different bound for quantum correlations as $2\\sqrt{2}$. This is reffered to as the Tsirelon's bound. To prove this we can suppose we have four hermitian operators $A_0,A_1,B_0,B_1$ where $[A_i,B_j] = 0$ but the $[A_0,A_1] \\neq 0$ and $[B_0,B_1] \\neq 0$. We define these $A$ operators as being two different spin measurements on the same electron and $B$ being the same on the positron where their results are either $+1$ or $-1$. We know that for a simple spin system $[\\sigma\\cdot\\vec{a},\\sigma\\cdot\\vec{b}] = 2\\iota\\sigma\\cdot(\\vec{a}\\times\\vec{b})$. Now we will define a new operator called $\\mathcal{B}$\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{B} = A_0B_0 + A_0B_1 + A_1B_0 - A_1B_1$$\n",
    "This operator has been defined along the lines of the bell's measure where expectation value of the modulus of this operator would be the actual bells measure for a correlation function of $C_{ij} = \\langle A_iB_j\\rangle$. We can now square this operator and it would simpify as the equation below (since $A_i^2 = B_i^2 = I$)\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{B}^2 = 4I - [A_0,A_1][B_0,B_1]$$\n",
    "Since these are spin operators we have $|[A_0,A_1][B_0,B_1]| \\leq 4I$ using the commutation relation we had defined earlier. We would infact have $\\mathcal{B}^2$ reach it's maximum if $A_0,B_0$ measures along $\\hat{x}$ and $A_1,B_1$ measures along $\\hat{y}$ which would make $\\mathcal{B}^2 = 8I$. This leads us to $\\langle \\mathcal{B}\\rangle \\leq 2\\sqrt{2}$ which is the Tsirelon's bound [[7](#ref-7)]. In this paper the $B_{max}$ values are bounded above due to Tsirelon's bound.\n"
