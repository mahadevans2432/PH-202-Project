    "## Introduction\n",
    "Bell states or entangled states are a very common idea in the realm of quantum computing. The idea behind a bell state is that the measurement of one qubit is perfectly correlated to the measurement of the other. So while a partial measurement of only one qubit would lead the observer to believe that the state is not pure (the quantum computing equivalent of coherence in optics), the state is infact pure when a correlated measurement of the two qubits is carried out at the same time. This has interesting applications such as quantum teleportation, superdense coding and quantum cryptography. While bell states have been studied thoroughly in the field of quantum computing, there are not many studies that explore the classical analogue of bell states. In this project, we have tried to explore the this topic mainly along the ideas presented in reference [[1](#ref-1)]. \n",
    "<p> The main idea we are trying to explore is that it is possible to couple two degrees of freedom (DOFs) of a beam of light, in the context of our discussion, polarisation and parity, such that when a measurement of only one DOF is made (independent of the other), it is possible for the beam to appear partially coherent or even completely incoherent, while the the beam is infact completely coherent (in the sense that there is nothing 'random' about the beam). This hidden coupling can be made evident by actually performing a correlated bell state measurement between the two DOFs, and also allows us to distinguish true randomness (partial coherence) from entanglement. It is also possible to look at coherence as a resource that can be shared among different DOFs, for example, we can start with a completely unpolarised beam which is parity coherent, and convert it to a beam which is perfectly polarised but parity incoherent. Further, we have tried to explore the relevance of this scheme to a classical implementation of a quantum computer, which can infact be shown to be universal, but is limited in the fact that the scheme is hard to generalise to a large number of qubits. </p> "

    "## 1. Polarization & Spatial Parity\n",
    "\n",
    "In the paper [[1](#ref-1)] the experiments which were done were made using of an optical beam model with two binary degrees of freedom, specifically polarization and spatial parity along the $x$ direction (vertically upwards) respectively of a quasi monochromatic source, where the beam is travelling in the $z$ direction.<br>\n",
    "For the spatial parity, in one dimension the beams are of form $E(x) = E_e\\psi_e(x)+E_o\\psi_o(x)$ where $\\psi_e(x)$ is an even function and $\\psi_o(x) = \\text{sgn}(x)\\psi_e(x)$ hence is an odd function. We give this beam a vector representation called $\\mathbf{J}_\\text{par} = [E_e\\text{ } E_o]^T$. Spatial parity is manipulated using a spatial light modulator (SLM) which we describe in the experimental apparatus section. Along with the horizontal (H) and vertical components of polarization taken into account we describe the polarization-parity jones vector as $\\mathbf{J} = [E_\\text{He}\\text{ }E_\\text{Ho}\\text{ }E_\\text{Ve}\\text{ }E_\\text{Vo}]^T$.<br>\n",
    "We then describe the properties of this coherence using a $4\\times4$ matrix which is $\\mathbf{G} = \\langle\\mathbf{J}^{*}\\mathbf{J}^\\text{T}\\rangle$. Taking partial trace along $\\mathbf{G}$ would give us either $\\mathbf{G}_\\text{pol}$ or $\\mathbf{G}_\\text{par}$ on taking trace along parity or polarization respectively. We define a degree of polarization/parity using $D_{\\text{pol}}$($D_\\text{par}$) which quantifies the apparent coherence of each DoF when the other DoF is unresolved. Further an overall coherence $S$ is defined using the beam's linear entropy [[2](#ref-2)] as follows.\n",
    "The definition of linear entropy comes from the motivation of von Neumann Entropy. For a quantum mechanical system with a density matrix $\\rho$ this is defined as $S_v = \\text{Tr}(-\\rho\\ln(\\rho)) = -\\langle\\ln(\\rho)\\rangle$. The linear entropy $S_L$ is a lower approximation to $S_v$ which comes from expanding the leading term in the expansion of $\\rho\\ln\\rho$ which becomes $\\rho-\\rho^2$ approximately when $\\rho$ is close to $I$ (using taylor expansion) and taking trace this gives us the definition $S_L = \\text{Tr}(\\rho) - \\text{Tr}(\\rho^2)$ and by definition of the density matrix we have trace of $\\rho$ equal to 1 which gives us $S_L = 1 - \\text{Tr}(\\rho^2)$. This is a non normalized quantity so this is normalized by multiplying it by $\\frac{d}{d-1}$ which here is $4/3$ since our system has four dimensions. The definition of our $\\mathbf{G}$ matrix is isomorphic to the definition of a density matrix of a two qubit system keeping the Jones vector $\\mathbf{J}$ as the state of this two qubit system. Hence we have \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:1.1}\\tag{1.1}S = 1-S_L = 1 - \\frac{4}{3} + \\frac{4}{3}\\text{Tr}(\\mathbf{G}^2) = \\frac{4}{3}\\left(\\text{Tr}\\{\\mathbf{G}^2\\}-\\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\end{equation}\n",
    "We know that for normalized states we have that $\\frac{1}{d}\\leq$ Tr$(\\rho^2) \\leq 1$ and equals one only for a pure state and $1/d$ for completely mixed state. We can similarly draw a parallel here to seeing that $S=1$ happens only for coherent (pure) states and is 0 when completely incoherent. An important note to make here is that applying a unitary matrix $U$ (so $U^{*}U^{T} = I$) which is not time dependent on the Jones vector would not change our value of $S$ since on acting of a unitary we would have $\\mathbf{G}' = U^{*}\\mathbf{G}U^{T}$ and so $\\mathbf{G}'^2 = U^{*}\\mathbf{G}^2U^{T}$ and this has same trace as $\\mathbf{G}^2$ since trace is invariant under unitary transforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper here explores the properties of a beam where these two DoFs are infact coupled or entagled. One can start with a coherent linearly polarized beam at $45^\\circ$ with even polarity which would be $\\mathbf{J} = (1/\\sqrt{2})[\\text{1 0 1 0}]^T$ which can clearly be factored into a direct product of $\\mathbf{J}_{\\text{pol}}\\otimes\\mathbf{J}_\\text{par}$ and so $D_\\text{pol} = D_\\text{par} = 1$. However on passing this beam through a polarization sensitive SLM which introduces a phase of $\\varphi/2\\sin(\\varphi)$ only to the horizontal polarity component and none to the vertical. We can think of this analoguos to a controlled $R_x(\\varphi)$ operation from the polarization qubit to parity qubit which acts when polarization is $|0\\rangle$ (called H here for polarization). This puts the state to an entagled state $\\mathbf{J} = (1/\\sqrt{2})[\\cos(\\varphi/2)\\text{ }\\iota\\sin(\\varphi/2)\\text{ 1 0}]^T$ which is no longer factorizable and shows that the apparant degree of coherence of the individual DoFs are no longer equal to 1 unless $\\varphi=0$ and infact equal zero when $\\varphi=\\pi$. However we know that this state is still coherent on an overall, the only issue is that seeing the partial trace of $\\mathbf{G}$ along the respective DoF provide an incomplete picture of the state hence leading to a conclusion that the coherence is absent. The paper proceeds to make use of the Bell's measure (see [Appendix A](#Appendix-A:-The-EPR-paradox-and-Bell's-inequalities)) to quantify this entanglement which is the cause of this apparent coherence deficit."

    "For the experimental setup, we are using various separate components, which we will comment on one by one before seeing how they are arranged together for the experiment in this paper. We can develop a matrix operator formalism based on how these elements affect the vector $\\mathbf{J} = [E_{He} \\ E_{Ho} \\ E_{Ve} \\ E_{Vo}]^T$. Suppoe we have a device that modifies the Jones vector of a beam in the following way - $\\mathbf{J_{new}} = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{J_{old}}$. Then, the corresponding $\\mathbf{G} = \\langle \\mathbf{J^*J^T}\\rangle$ tranforms as $\\mathbf{G_{new} = A^*G_{old}A^T}$. This is because, assuming that the effect of the device, encoded in matrix $\\mathbf{A}$  is time independent, the matrix can just move inside the time average.

There is no operator matrix associated with it, it simply separates out the two beams, without affecting parity at all. One point to note here - as we describe below, a mirror will add a factor of (-1) to odd modes, so the component which gets reflected will pick up that factor here as well. We can either correct this with a second reflection of that beam from a $45^\\circ$ mirror to correct it or not do anything at all about it (in the experimental setup in the paper seen as a whole, we can see that it won't matter the odd and even beams will be switched, but that is about it.)\n",

It performs the same matrix operation as a mirror, but is more convenient to use. One aspect to be careful of (that can be easily overcome) is that there is a phase change because the beam travels through the glass/ material of the prism, but that can be easily dealt with by using a compensator cell in the other arm. Another important aspect of a Dove prism - since the wave incidence medium is denser and the transmission medium is rarer (unlike a regular mirror), there is no addition $\\pi$ phase of reflection, and the operator matrix is simply $$\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}e \\\\ o \\end{pmatrix}_{old} = \\begin{pmatrix}e \\\\ o \\end{pmatrix}_{new}$$\n",

Hence, we have constructive interference at Out2.

Only relative phase/ difference in phase between top and bottom half being $\\phi$ is what matters.) Then, we are effectively multiplying the old profile $E_{old}(x)$ by $e^{\\iota\\frac{\\phi}{2}sgn(x)}$, to get new profile $E_{new}(x)$. Observe that $e^{\\iota\\frac{\\phi}{2}sgn(x)} = cos(\\frac{\\phi}{2})+ \\iota sgn(x)sin(\\frac{\\phi}{2})$.

With a complete coupling ($\\phi = \\pi$ radians) the parity as well as polarisation appear completely incoherent by themselves, while we expect the beam to infact be partially coherent, since it was parity coherent to begin with.

This also demostrates how we can make coherence essentially migrate from form of coupling to apparent coherence of individual DoFs by simply using unitary transforms.\n"

    "## 5. Reduced representation of the two Binary DoFs\n",
    "We can represent any arbitrary partially coherent beam by the three invariants $S$, $S_{pol}$, $S_{par}$. Every point in the volume generated represents different beams which can be related via unitary transformations that do not couple the two DoFs, since these ensure that $S$, $S_{pol}$, $S_{par}$ remain invariant. Points with the same $S$ comprise of a plane. All the points in this plane are related via unitary transformations which couple the two DoFs, since these would ensure $S$ remains the same but $S_{pol}$ and $S_{par}$ do not.\n",
    "A beam with higher $S$, by the definition of the measure, has higher coherency. \n",
    "\n",
    "The figure offers us two insights into how $S$, $S_{pol}$, $S_{par}$ for a beam might be related.<br>\n",
    "Firstly, beams with the same value of $S$ do not take arbitrary values of $S_{pol}$ and $S_{par}$. For a given value of $S$ for a beam, the figure uniquely gives us a concave-sided triangular area within which the values of $S_{pol}$ and $S_{par}$ must be contained for a partially coherent beam.<br>\n",
    "Secondly, for given values of $S_{pol}$ and $S_{par}$ for a partially coherent beam, we can predict the overall degree of coherence of the beam $S$ by drawing a line segment parallel to the $S$ axis contained within the figure, which gives us a narrow range within which $S$ must be for the beam. The paper suggests that the uncertainty in determining $S$ using this method is $\\sim6\\%$ on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall purpose of generating the figure was to show that we cannot have all combinations of $S$, $S_{pol}$, $S_{par}$ inside the unit cube in the first octant but only the ones which satisfy Bell's Inequality, which results in the obtained figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our attempt to generate the figure, we have essentially constructed a Monte-Carlo simulation with $10^5$ points based on the discussion in [[8](#ref-8)].<br>\n",
    "Since eigenvalues of G have to be real, positive and their sum must be 1, we first generate a diagonal matrix $D$ of the eigenvalues with the contraints applied. Now, to obtain a random G, we must first obtain a random unitary matrix $U$ and apply the following transformation on the diagonal matrix $D$.<br>\n",
    "<center>$G=UDU^{\\dagger}$</center>\n",
    "We obtain $U$ by first generating a random matrix and then QR factorizing it. Since Q is unitary, we have in essence found a random unitary matrix. The above set of operations is implemented in the function <code>randG()</code>.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "After this, we proceed to define the function  <code>C_ta_pa()</code> which calculates the correlation function for a given matrix $G$ with the parameters $t_{1} (\\theta_{a})$ and $p_{1} (\\phi_{a})$. The Bell Measure is calculated by the function  <code>B()</code> by making calls to the function <code>C_ta_pa()</code>.<br>\n",
    "Now, the calculation of the value $S$ is straightforward from the matrix $G$ and that of $D_{pol}$ and $D_{par}$ is also relatively straightforward once the matrices $G_{pol}$ and $G_{par}$ have been constructed. But, for the calculation of $S_{pol}$ and $S_{par}$, we need to determine the value $B_{max}$ first. Since there was no way the optimization of $10^5$ matrices could've been tensorized, we calculate this in loop for all the G matrices and that is what constitutes the bulk of the running time of the program. We implement this in the function  <code>genS()</code> below."

    "## 6. Quantum Circuits\n",
    "As one may have already noticed, the behavior of the system here can be accurately modelled using quantum systems where instead of coherence one measures the purity of a state. We make use of the IBM Qiskit libraries to build these experimental setups into their equivalent quantum circuits making use of ancillary qubits to create inherently mixed states. The main idea here is that for experiment A we would only need the two qubits each representing one DoF to model this system and reproduce the results using the appropriate operators.\n",
    "### Interpretation of the model\n",
    "<p>The first qubit (indexed by 0) refers to the polarisation DOF and the second qubit (index 1) refers to the parity DOF. We will take the $|1\\rangle$ state of polarity to mean pure V-polarisation and $|0\\rangle$ state to mean pure H-polarisation. Similarly, we take the $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ states of the parity qubit to mean purely even and purely odd mode, respectively.</p>\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "    <tr><td>Parity-polarisation state</td><td>Qubit configuration</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>He</td><td>00</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>Ho</td><td>01</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>Ve</td><td>10</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>Vo</td><td>11</td></tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "<p>Further, we will always use any ancilla qubits we need, to replicate the probabilistic devices (like random rotator or probabilistic PS-SLM) to be the initial qubits, the second last qubit will represent polarisation, and the last qubit represents parity.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "For experiment B one of our state is starting in an impure form, something which cannot be reached if one were to only apply unitary transformations. Here we make use of an ancillary qubit which is coupled with the rest of the two qubits and hence is in a way storing the coherence we wished to get rid off as part of it's coupling. The main idea of this paper was that partial trace matrices do not give us the complete picture of the system which we can demonstrate very simply just by using a bell state (a pure state) and noting that it's partial traces are actually representative of impure states.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this section is to demonstrate a simulation which is based in quantum mechanics which reproduces the results of classical coherence obtained in this paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "A small point to add is that in qiskit the representation is not with zeroth qubit being MSB and last qubit being LSB but the other way round. In experiment A for example $q_0$ is the polarization qubit and $q_1$ is the parity qubit and so Ho is actually 10 and Ve is 01 and so on."

    "### 6.1 Experiment A\n",
    "For this experiment we take $q_0$ as the polarization DoF and $q_1$ as the parity DoF. Based on the matrix forms of the experimental apparatus we can see that applying an HWP is analogous to a $R_y(\\theta)Z$ on $q_0$ and the SLM is $R_x(-\\phi)$ and the PSSLM is just the SLM as a controlled operation except that it activates for $q_0$ being in 0 instead of 1 so we just apply a NOT on that bit before and after the controlled gate. The measurement done in the end uses the statevector simulator of qiskit to directly calculate probabilities based on the state of the system. While running multiple shots using one of the real quantum computers one can access using IBM-Q would have been more impressive, those will come with heavy noise outputs would require additional noise and error mitigation procedures."

    "### 6.2 Experiment B\n",
    "Here in the experiment a random rotator is used to generate what would be measured as unpolarized light. As stated before the coherence of a the DoFs are analogous to a qubit being in a mixed or pure state. Since we are working with idealized qubits the state of the system will always remain pure however if one were to look into just the hilbert space of few of the qubits but not all we would have it perceived as an impure state. Here unpolarized light would have a coherency (density) matrix which is diagonal with both entries equal to 1/2. This is a completely mixed state and we can generate this by looking at the partial trace of a qubit which is paired with another qubit as the bell state $\\dfrac{|00\\rangle + |11\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}$. Hence we make use of $q_0$ as an ancillary qubit which is present as a bell pair with $q_1$ which is now the polarization qubit. $q_2$ is the parity qubit. As we can see since we do not measure the $q_0$ qubit we would actually see $q_1$ behave like a mixed state which is what the random rotator actually achieves. More specifically the bell state we have described has half probability for any state on the XZ plane of the bloch sphere and since the random rotator is a $R_yZ$ operation the system as a whole is essentially composed of all states on the XZ plane which would be described by observing one qubit out of this bell pair."

    "### 6.3 Experiment C\n",
    "In experiment C the paper randomly chooses to either couple the DoFs or not with probability of $P$ and $1-P$ respectively. To recreate this I again make use of an ancillary qubit $q_0$ similar to section [6.2](#6.2-Experiment-B). The idea is to create this in the state $\\sqrt{1-P}|0\\rangle + \\sqrt{P}|1\\rangle$ and use a controlled-Rx gate with angle $-\\pi$ with $q_0$ and $q_1$ (polarization) as control bits where polarization needs to be 0 and ancilla needs to be 1 to activate this rotation. The circuit used decomposes the two control gate using the standard procedure for decomposing two control single target qubit gates if the single control gate is available."

    "### Universality using optical components\n",
    "Our main reference for this is [[3](#ref-3)]. To fully realize quantum computing (or any form of computing) one needs a physical system capable of producing the minimal set of operations which can then be extended to a set of all possible operations and sequences of operations. In classical computers the complete set is realized using the set of operations $\\{\\lnot,\\land\\}$ or $\\{\\lnot,\\lor\\}$. For quantum computers universality would imply being able to make any circuit which essentially means the set of all unitary matrices. This of course is non inclusive of measurements (which will not keep a circuit unitary) but one can prove that measurements placed in the middle of a cicuit can be taken to the very end without affecting the final measurement probabilities (since once measured any qubit is essentially decohered and cannot be part of the circuit anyway). \n",
    "\n",
    "To get the complete set of unitary matrices we can first start for the case of a single qubit. This set would essentially be the $SU(2)$ group which is isomorphic to $SO(3)$ and given that we have an $R_x(\\theta)$ gate in form of the SLM we actually just need rotation about some other axis to achieve single qubit universality for parity. The polarization qubit does have a $R_y(\\theta)Z$ qubit which can be used to get the hadamard gate $H$ with $\\theta = \\pi/2$ and in combination with a quarter wave plate with fast axis horizontal which is effectively the square root of $Z$ denoted with an $S$ (ignoring global phase) we can actually make the HWP just be a pure $R_y(\\theta)$. Additionally using $\\theta=\\pi$ we can make this into an $X$ gate ignoring global phase. The importance of this $X$ gate is that if we apply the gate sequence $X$-PSSLM-$X$ it is effectively a PSSLM which applies the operation of the SLM when the polarization is vertical which transalates exactly into a controlled $R_x(\\phi)$ operation which we will use in our analysis below. \n",
    "\n",
    "The PS-SLM is an operator which controls the parity using the polarity and is essentially a controlled Rx gate and so can be made into a CNOT gate which adds an additional phase of $\\iota$ to the horizontal polarization component. To make the CNOT of the other way we can try for the MZI configuration proposed [here](#Proposal-for-a-Parity-Sensitive-Polarisation-Modifier). The point here is that once we have these two CNOTS, we can essentially get universal unitaries by swapping the polarization (see cells below) and parity qubit in such a way that we can apply an Rx gate followed by Ry and then another Rx with the appropriate euler angles and we can attain individual qubit universalities of $U3$ gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact CNOT operation where polarization is control and parity is target involves making use of a quarter wave plate which has the operator form of $e^{-\\iota\\pi/4}\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\\\0 & \\iota\\end{pmatrix}$ on the polarization qubit so that we can induce a relative phase between H and V of polarization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now for getting overall universality we just need the CNOT gates of both ways and since we already have that using the PSSLM and the MZI setup described previously we actually have a universal quantum computer of two qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "A small note to be made is that the U3 gates have unique euler angles upto a global phase being ignored. Now we have established that global phase is useless here for a 1 qubit case but with two qubits a controlled-$U$ gate has importance on global phase of $U$. To tackle this we can simply make use of the decomposition of $U$ such that first a controlled $\\tilde{U}$ where $\\tilde{U}$ can be written as just the rotations ($R_y(\\theta_3)R_x(\\theta_2)R_y(\\theta_1)$ or $R_x(\\theta_3)R_y(\\theta_2)R_x(\\theta_1)$ depending on the qubit) ignoring the global phase and say $U=e^{\\iota\\alpha}\\tilde{U}$ we simply apply the gate equivalent to $R_z(\\alpha/2)$ to the control qubit. While applying this $z$ rotation we just introduce a relative phase of $\\alpha$ between the $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ of the control qubit which is equivalent to a controlled $U$ if done after the controlled $\\tilde{U}$. Note that global phase of this last gate does not concern us since that is global for both qubits unlike a controlled gate. "

Since we have shown that polarization is capable of arbitray $R_x$ rotations and parity qubits are capable of arbitrary $R_y$ rotations we can follow the following sequence of steps for U3 gates on polarization as shown below. We take the euler angles for $Y-X-Y$ and first apply $R_y$ on polarization, swap with parity and apply a $R_x$ on parity after that. Finally swap again and do the final $R_y$ on the polarization qubit. We follow a similar procedure for parity U3 gates but instead use euler angles of $X-Y-X$."

    "## 7. Concluding Remarks\n",
    "The exceeding of $B_\\text{max}$ beyond the value of 2 in quantum mechanics implied that one cannot use locally deterministic hidden variable theories to explain quantum mechanics or simply put proves that quantum mechanics violates local realism. Here we have seen that $B_\\text{max}$ exceeds this classical limit and one can conclude equivalently that one cannot write the correlation function as some $C(\\theta_a,\\phi_a) = \\int d\\lambda\\rho(\\lambda)C_\\text{pol}(\\theta_a,\\lambda)C_\\text{par}(\\phi_a,\\lambda)$ where $\\lambda$ is some set of hidden variables. The proper proof of this is described in [Appendix A](#Appendix-A:-The-EPR-paradox-and-Bell's-inequalities) and the experimental results concur with this. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a way this shows that if one were to have two DoFs, there would be an uncertainty which arises due their coupling which is quantised by using the Bell's measure. These results would hold good regardless of the type of DoF used and can be extended to systems with a higher number of DoFs too. We also explored how one can link this with quantum systems and reproduced the results using a quantum computer simulation of IBM Q.\n",

    "More importantly one must take note of how looking at the coherency behaviors of the individual DoFs would not address the actual coherence it had since some of it would be 'shared' in form of coupling. In short the partial traces of coherency matrices offer an incomplete picture of the system quite similar to how one would deal with multi qubit systems and have the state behave mixed when only looking at the partial trace over a part of the Hilber space. We even took advantage of this incomplete picture to create mixed states in the previous section. This also demonstrates how one could effectively share coherence between two DoFs as seen in experiment B where the coherency $S_\\text{pol}$ of the polarization qubit is effectively increased at maximal entaglement with the fully coherent parity DoF."

    "Before talking about the bell's measure let us first dive into why it was made and for this we must look at the EPR experiment proposed in [[4](#ref-4)]. I will discuss Bohm's variant since Bell's response was made in a way to that. Say we have prepared a electron-positron pair coming from a single source. These would be entangled in a way where if we measure the spin of one of the particles, the other particle will simultaneously collapse to the opposite spin.\n",
    "$$|{\\psi}\\rangle = \\dfrac{|{\\uparrow_e\\downarrow_p}\\rangle + |{\\downarrow_e\\uparrow_p}\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\n",
    "So the main issue which Einstein had was that this means that measurement on one particle directly affects the other no matter how far it is. This makes it a non local effect which clearly does not make sense in a world which was believed to follow local realism. It can be proven that the two agents have no way to communicate using this pair hence showing that there actually is no faster than light comminication. While one may think choosing basis in a certain manner can change measurement probabilities and essentially have some \"information\" change, no matter how much measurements are done, since this is probabilistic the other agent cannot conclude anything from that.\n",

    "While there have been multiple responses to this, the most important one is the one discussed in Bell's paper [[5](#ref-5)].\n",
    "First we will start by considering the EPR argument using spin particles. Consider a pair of spin one-half particles formed somehow in the singlet spin state and moving freely in opposite directions. Measurements can be made, say by Stern-Gerlach magnets, on selected components of the spins $\\vec{\\sigma_1}$ and $\\vec{\\sigma_2}$,\n",

To prove this we can suppose we have four hermitian operators $A_0,A_1,B_0,B_1$ where $[A_i,B_j] = 0$ but the $[A_0,A_1] \\neq 0$ and $[B_0,B_1] \\neq 0$.

We know that for a simple spin system $[\\sigma\\cdot\\vec{a},\\sigma\\cdot\\vec{b}] = 2\\iota\\sigma\\cdot(\\vec{a}\\times\\vec{b})$. Now we will define a new operator called $\\mathcal{B}$\n",
